## The Odin Project - Intermediate JS project

LIVE SITE [HERE](https://hello-damiro.github.io/weather)

**Day 1:** Prepared design at figma. Focusing on the DOM elements that will use weather API. Preparing the design for future updates like unsplash API for the background images.I could probably finished this in 1 seating if all the UI design details are in place. Was able to fetch weather data complete with error handling using promise on a separate module. Last project was very helpful in that topic.

Hopefully I could have the time to fully finish this project. I had fun doing this. I'd like to integrate this to the todo app and be my default page for a browser. **_Completed 12 April 2023_**

## Resources

Im in a time constraints; if I have more time, I could've redraw all the 200+ icons used in the api. `weatherapi.com/docs/` provided the [icons used](https://cdn.weatherapi.com/weather.zip) together with the conditions from the [conditional text list](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/weather_conditions.csv)

## Challenges

1. Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just `console.log()` the information.
2. Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
3. Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just `console.log()` it).
4. Display the information on your webpage! Add any styling you like!
5. Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
6. Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
